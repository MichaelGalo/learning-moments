# My Application

## Overview
This application is a simple client-side CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application that uses a JSON database. It was developed as a learning project to understand the basics of client-side CRUD functionality prior to my capstone season. The goal of this app was to showcase whenever you or someone you know has an "ah-ha!" moment to share -- sort of like a more philosophical twitter clone.

## Learning Objectives
- Gain basic proficiency with React coming from vanilla JS.
- Understand the basics of client-side CRUD operations.
- Manage Routing in React-Router-Dom
- Effective ERD & Wireframing
